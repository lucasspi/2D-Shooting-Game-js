# JS-2D Shooter
A simple 2D shooting game created in JavaScript.

You are a laser machine gun weilding maniac determined on anihalating the terrible 'block' monsters. You've been stationed 
in a outpost, called nowhere land. Your objective is to shoot block monsters before they get cross your post 
and take over the nearby city in which you are suppose to protect. If more than three monsters get across, the city 
is doomed and if that isn't enough ... you are probably dead! Go save the city.

Discalaimer: This game is not develped in full yet. Needs major design, and needs to get a few kinks out. Next up is 
implemnation of levels.
